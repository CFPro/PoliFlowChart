# PoliFlowChart
Repository for my PoliFlow application.

## Description
A website focused on many different political issues.  Anybody can start a new political issue.  When they do, they need to justify their position and create logical steps on how they derived to that political position on the issue.  Here is an example:

Political Issue: ACA is a good policy for the American people.
Step 1: Sign up for ACA through your state health exchange
Step 2: You fill out a simple questionaire
Step 3: You qualify for subsidy based on the income/dependence
Step 4: You pick your health plan (bronze, silver, gold)
...
Step 20: You get insurance, and you can visit any doctor you like.

There could be many steps involved, but others users will pick apart your logical steps, and interject.  Some will tell you Step 20 is wrong, and create a comment that says, "Obama admitted that in some cases you will not be able to keep your doctor, and have a link proving that."  In addition, they could branch off step 20, and create a new logic step and name it "ACA will not allow me to see the doctor I trusted for 20 years".

The Poliflowchart will grow over time, and it will educate people on a political view that will encompass every political position around that political issue.  People will get a real insightful overview, and will be able to weigh the positive and negatives.  People can vote on each logical step, the choices would be "Like, Dislike, Conspiracy"

## User Interface

This is a great start

I would eliminate the comment, when you click on one of the steps, it can open a comment section below the entire flowchart area.  People can start discussing that one step.

Any changes to the flowchart itself, will go into review to make sure it is not garbage.
